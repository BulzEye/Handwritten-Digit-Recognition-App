# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-App
A deep learning project created as part of our course CS304N on Computational Intelligence. Involves a ensemble model combining three classification models, running in Jupyter using TensorFlow, with a React app frontend accessing the model via a Flask backend built into the Jupyter notebook.
